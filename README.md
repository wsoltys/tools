### simplehttp6
SimpleHTTP6.py is a simple IPv4 and IPv6 HTTP Webserver based on the SimpleHTTPServer of python2.
It also supports uploading files via POST.

### srce
srce.py is a small rce shell in python3. I used it for a hackthebox openbsd machine but it can be easily altered for other purposes.
Note: downloaded files gets encoded/decoded via base64. Since its for an openbsd system, its using b64encode. You have to alter it for other Linux based systems.
